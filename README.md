# Unsupervised Learning Methods for Satellite Data Classification

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the application of unsupervised learning methods for the classification of satellite imagery data. The notebooks explore different algorithms, including K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to discriminate between sea ice and leads from Sentinel-2 optical data and altimetry data from Sentinel-3.

## Overview

The project includes:

- Introduction to unsupervised learning methods.
- Image classification using K-means and GMM.
- Altimetry data classification.
- Methods for quantifying echo classification against official ESA classifications.
- Visualization of clustering results
- Using comfusion matrix (incompleted)

## Prerequisites

Before finish the task, ensure that you have the following tools:

- Google drive
- Google colaboratory
- Data downloaded from ESA
- Juputer notebook link: https://cpomucl.github.io/GEOL0069-AI4EO/Chapter1%3AData_Colocating_S2_S3.html
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/unsupervised-satellite-classification.git
```

## Usage

Navigate to the specific notebook corresponding to the algorithm you are interested in (e.g., , ) and run the cells in order to follow the analysis and obtain the results.'K-means_Clustering.ipynb''GMM.ipynb'

## Data

The satellite data used for analysis is processed and loaded within the notebooks. It utilizes Sentinel-2 optical data and Sentinel-3 altimetry data. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions and access to the data required for these notebooks.
